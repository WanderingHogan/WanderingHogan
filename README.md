### Hello world 👋

My name is Chris Hogan, and I am a developer with 15 years of experience.

I started in geospatial, building mostly with python and javascript. I still do a lot of javascript, but also manage a small team of engineers distributed across 12 timezones building a decentralized chat app.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [Satellite.im](https://satellite.im) as the Head of Engineering
- 🌱 I’m currently learning rust, vue3, and how to be a better manager
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on interesting geospatial or javascript problems/products
- 📫 My email is chris at hogan dot io, or on twitter I am [@wanderinghogan](https://twitter.com/WanderingHogan)
- 📍 I live near Boulder, Colorado, USA
